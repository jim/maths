# Maths

I'm learning about Rubinius and writing a language or two in the process. This
is the first thing I've built. It's rickety, but it can do some simple math
(including proper support for operator precedence).

You can try out Maths by running the examples:

~~~ sh
$ bin/maths examples/calculations.maths
42
76

Check out the specs to see what Maths can do FOR YOU.
